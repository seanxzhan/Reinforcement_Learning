Reinforcement learning projects

Followed YouTube tutorials and built A.I.'s that play various games using Q-learning and Q-learning with convolutional neural networks.

Run the following command to install all the packages needed to run this project:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Note that ```pip install gym[atari]``` wouldn't correctlly install the atari environment on windows system. Refer to https://github.com/openai/gym/issues/1726 to do necessary setups before executing the previous command.
